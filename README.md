# About This Project

This is a remake version of famous MMORPG game [Galaxy on Fire: Alliances](https://galaxyonfire.fandom.com/wiki/Galaxy_on_Fire:_Alliances "Fandom Page"), which the servers have been shut down officially on June 28th, 2019.

The project aims not to recover or reuse the art resources made by its original producer Fishlabs ([Deepsilver ](https://www.dsfishlabs.com/)for now), so the remake would **not** involve any decompiling or models digging as well.

Basically this would be a new game, only the settings (Eg. game play structure, overall story background, specific terms) would be inherited. But base on further discussion with the copyrights holder, these might also change in the future.

# Maintainers

We are several former GoFA players who have a common wish to revive the game with our own hands. 

If you have interest in helping us pushing the project ahead, you may contact project initiator Clement_Levi.

Currently we work irregularly (in the timezone GMT+8), as we are merely doing this project in part-time. But maybe with enough motivation we could divert some more attention to it ;>


**Working languages:** Chinese, English


# Development Progress

Unfortunately due to the lack of manpower and project developing experiences, this project is making little progress... But we are still slowly crawling forward.
